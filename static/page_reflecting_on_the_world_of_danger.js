<h1>Reflecting on the dangerous world</h1>

<h2>God made the world broken and dangerous</h2>
<ol>
<li>
	<h3>
		God imposed a impredictible dangerousness to the world as a consequence of sin
	</h3>
	<p>
		The world is a dangerous place and very, very, bad things will hapen to both believers, and non believers.
	</p>

		<li>The death of believers on 2024 Garzon's fatal car crash</li>
		<li>The death of a Christian teen in a church activity on a car accident</li>
		<li>The death of 200.000 on the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami</li>

	<h3>
		God's protection is not a gaurantee of earthly safety, but a inmense reduction of tragedy for the believer and his related ones, that according to God's plans, can be removed.
	</h3>
	<p>
		Every believer can testify of unexplicable instances of protection from God in many circumstances.
	</p>
	<p>
		Although God allows terrible suffering for believers at times, nonetheless, He also lovingly protects them constantly.

<li>
	<h3>
		Preciselly for this that we must seek God's protection and be prudent in the world of danger.
	</h3>
	<p>
		Because we already know that tragedy will hapen to both believers and non-believers, we must be wise in the world of danger, because more bad things will happen to those lacking wisdom.
	</p>
	<p>
		We must live with outmost prudence, but also aknowledge that doing it won't also be a guarantee, only God's protection can keep us from terrible suffering.
	</p>
	<p>
		Nonetheless, we must remember that God's plan for us can involve tragedy despite of the righteousness of Jesus and our piety.

<h2>We must prepare for tragedy by reflecting of the dimmension of Sin</h2>
<ol>
<li>
	<h3>On God's Eyes, sin is so evil that deserves death</h3>
	<p>According to God holliness, sin is so scandalous and evil, that requires a death penalty from a righteous arbit.</p>
	<p>Therefore, we must fight and kill the idea that we are so good that deserve all protection from tragedy.</p>
	<p>Tragedy is not a surprise for the clear thinker, the surprize is the fact that we are still alive
</p>
	<p>We must pray to God for illumination from the Spirit and wise teachers that helps us develop a correct perspective of reality.</p>
	<div><span>Gen.2.15-17</span><span>Rom.3.23</span></div>
</li>

<li>
	<h3>Fighthing the idea that the world is a good place and that people are God is paramount to handle reality</h3>
	<p>Only when we understand that our countries are dammed nations at the edge of being destructed by God, and that we are in a vicious enemity with God, we can make sense when God planns and executes tragedy.</p>
	<div><span>Sal.2</span><span>Sal.5.4</span><span>Sal.7.11</span></div>
</li>
<li>
	<h3>Only humble and sober acceptance of our unwordinnes of life can prepare us to live in the moment of tragedy</h3>
	<p>A strong doctrine of sin and creatureliness is what keep Job from apostasy.</p>
	<p>Nonetheless, a deeper and hidden sense of blessing merit from Job, propelled him to sin against God in the midst of unspeakable suffering.</p>
	<p>Expecting non-tragedy or reacting with anger towards God is a mark of ignoring the character of the true God</p>

<h2>We must refuge on the hope of the gospel</h2>
<ol>

<li>
	<h3>We must seek confort in the creation restorative return of Jesus</h3>
	<p>
		We must accept that this world won't be fixed, and put our desire of peace, justice, and completelly secure living on the restored by Jesus future for believers.
	</p>
	<div>
		<span>Rom.8.18-24</span>
		<span>Is.11</span>
		<span>Apo.21.1-7</span>
	</div>
</li>

<li>
	<h3>
		We must destroy unto dust the cosmic grandpa Idol, by preaching and teaching the Sovering Creator and Judge that afflict humanity with sin's consecuenses.
	</h3>
	<p>
		Only accepting God's sovereignty and right to broke our sinful life and environment, can stop the thought storm in the midst of our tragedy. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Leaving our neighbor to wrestle with the doubt storm and conflict of that tragedy brings onto Idol worshipers is cruel.
	</p>
	<p>
		Persons that believe that God is too good to allow tragedy, are inconmensurabely broken and confused when tragedy arrives, and some fall into emotional atheism or embrace irrational confort to handle the crisis.
	</p>
	<p>
		The best way to navigate tragedy is humble and broken acceptance of God planned tragedy, hope for creation restoration on Chroist's return, and seek the Holy Spirit Consolation that comes to gospel believers.
	</p>
	<p>
		This is were doctrine destroys. Bad doctrine shaters hearts that suffer tragedy. Only sound doctrine prepares and consolates both believes and non believers.

	<h3>
	With true love for our neighbor, we must preach and disciple with the true consolation gospel
	</h3>
	<p>
	The only non-delusional hope for the tragedy is the restored life that gospel believers can find. Therefore, we must abandon our great comission stumbling sin and seek the Spirit filling church life to preach the gospel of consolation.
